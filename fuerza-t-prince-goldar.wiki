§ Prince Goldar (Fuerza-T)

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Prince Goldar** is a [[fuerza-t]] character.

**Fuerza-T** are action-figure toys created by **Top Toys** in [[argentina]] using the original [[masters-of-the-universe]] molds for plastic-injection-molding.

**Prince Goldar** is part of an unproduced set of prototypes that, in addition to **Prince Goldar**, included:

• [[fuerza-t-spector]]
• [[fuerza-t-silvar]]
• [[fuerza-t-infector]]

§§ Story

Although the back-story of the **Prince Goldar** is //not// widely known, because **Prince Goldar**'s blue hair color matches [[fuerza-t-shidoshi]]'s blue hair color, some have wondered if they are part of the same faction.

§§ Action Figure

Like most [[motu]] and [[fuerza-t]] action-figures, the **Prince Goldar** action-figure shared parts with other action-figures —

• **Prince Goldar**'s **head** is the same head as [[motu-he-man]], [[motu-faker]], and [[fuerza-t-silvar]].
• **Prince Goldar**'s **armor** is the same head as [[motu-fisto]], [[motu-clamp-champ]], and [[fuerza-t-shidoshi]].
