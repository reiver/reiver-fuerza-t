§ Silvar (Fuerza-T)

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Silvar** is a [[fuerza-t]] character.

**Fuerza-T** are action-figure toys created by **Top Toys** in [[argentina]] using the original [[masters-of-the-universe]] molds for plastic-injection-molding.

**Silvar** is part of an unproduced set of prototypes that, in addition to **Silvar**, included:


• [[fuerza-t-prince-goldar]]
• [[fuerza-t-spector]]
• [[fuerza-t-infector]]

§§ Story

Although the back-story of the **Silvar** is //not// widely known, because **Silvar**'s green hair color matches [[fuerza-t-platino]]'s green hair color, some have wondered if they are part of the same faction.

§§ Action Figure

Like most [[motu]] and [[fuerza-t]] action-figures, the **Silvar** action-figure shared parts with other action-figures —

• **Silvar**'s **head** is the same head as [[motu-he-man]], [[motu-faker]], and [[fuerza-t-prince-goldar]].
